You ever start up a new server for you and your friends, and end up quitting after a few days because the nearest living, breathing person is Bob at 21k blocks west?
Say no more.

This plugin changes up the health system. Gives it a little kick y'know?

WHAT DOES IT DO???
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every player in a customizable radius will gain a customizable health boost per player in said radius.
In other words; Apes Together Strong.

You said CUSTOMIZABLE??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure did! With the incredibly simple config.yml you can change this plugin to your liking in well under a minute!

- plugin-enabled: true

^ enables or disables the plugin without any seperate plugin managers

- base-health: 10

^ sets a base max health

- added-health: 2

^ sets how much health is added per nearby player

- toggle-max-health: false
- max-health: 69

^ allows you to enable and set a maximum amount of health

- range:
  x: 16
  y: 16
  z: 16
  
^ sets how far the radius stretches across each axis

- debugging-enabled: false
  
^ enables or disables debugging (console spam)

COMMANDS!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one single command, that is:
- /ats reload
What more could you ask for?

PERMISSIONS?!?!?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

yes permissions indeed.
I've tried to keep it relatively simple, with for now just a single permission.
- ats.reload

All it does is grant the abillity to reload the configs. It really is that simple.

Questions or suggestions are always welcome. (discord: kai.prod)
